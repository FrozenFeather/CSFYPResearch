The positive fraction (DC enriched) was further sorted into four DC subsets: CD1c+ mDC, SLAN+ DC, CD141+ mDC and CD123+ pDC, using a FACSAria (BD BioSciences). The negative fraction (DC depleted/mono) was stained with anti-CD14-FITC and anti-CD16-PE (BD Biosciences) antibodies, labeled with IgG beads (Miltenyi) and a positive selection performed using an AutoMACS (Miltenyi) to obtain a bulk monocyte population. These cells were further sorted to obtain the CD14+CD16- (CD14+) and CD16+CD14lo (CD16+) monocyte subsets using a FACSAria.
