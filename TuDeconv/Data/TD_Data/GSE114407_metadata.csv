Quantitative assessment of the purified total RNA was accomplished using a Qubit Broad Range RNA kit (Thermofisher), which was then qualitatively evaluated by a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies).","The sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit (Illumina Inc) and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 sequencer using a 100 cycle single-read cluster kit.","9606","Basecalls performed using CASAVA version 1.8.2","Sequenced reads were mapped to hg19 reference build with refGene GTF annotation version 25 using tophat 2.0.13","TopHat aligned BAMs were merged using MergeSamFiles from Picard v1.97","Reads counts are obtained using HTSeq v0.6.1 and TPM using RSEM v1.2.7","Genome_build: hg19","Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Comma-separated text file with raw counts and TPM quantification.","GPL16791","Eduardo,,Cortes","eduardo.cortes@roswellpark.org","Biostatistics and Bioinformatics","ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE","ELM AND CARLTON STREETS","BUFFALO","NY","14263","USA","0","Illumina HiSeq 2500","cDNA","transcriptomic","RNA-Seq","BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN09100959","SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX4074919","NONE","PBMC","Yes","P496","blood"
